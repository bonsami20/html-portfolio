<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samiratou Bonkoungou, a 23 years old girl from Burkina Faso, a country located in West of Africa. In 2018 I got a scholarship from my country to study BTech computer science in India. That's how I started to be interested into developing websites and applications.
  I graduated in May 2023 and I left India to come back in my country.
  My passion is guiding me to dive deep into developing and looking for more opportinuties.
